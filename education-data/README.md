# Education Data

Here we store data downloaded from the Education Data Portal. 

* The file `ipeds_directory_2021.csv` contains all of the [directory data](https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/colleges.html#ipeds_directory) pertaining to postsecondary higher education in the United States. It has a lot of categorical data as well as latitude and longitude columns. It was first used in the [Day One Map Making with Leaflet](https://observablehq.com/@columbia-data-club/leaflet-in-general-and-in-observable) Data Club Session in October 2024.
