# CUl Data Club Data

At Data Club meetings, we often load in some data. It started to make sense to make a special repository for those files.

These data are all publicly available, though they may be altered in some way in preparation for Data Club meetings. They should not be considered authoritative, nor should this repository be considered a repository of open data. Itâ€™s merely here to provide continuity for the notebooks, etc., that Data Club uses.
